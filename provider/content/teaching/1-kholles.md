I was an oral examiner in mathematics at Lycée Condorcet
and then [Lycée Louis-Le-Grand](http://louislegrand.org/). 
Every week, I met with six
freshmen during two one-hour sessions and trained them for the oral entrance
examinations of the French Grandes Écoles. A selection of some of my favorite 
exercises can be found [here](/pdf/colles.pdf) (currated with [Léonard Blier](http://leonardblier.fr/)).
