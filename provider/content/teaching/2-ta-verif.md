title: Teaching Assistant for a Software Verification Class
when: Fall 2017
---

I was a Teaching Assistant for an introductory software verification class
([15-414](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/)), taught by Matt Fredrikson and
Andr√© Plazer. In particular, I designed a set of five labs relying on the 
[Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) verification platform, which led students to
writing a fully verified implementation of a SAT solver with unit propagation.
I was also responsible for teaching the two lectures introducing the Why3 platform.

"Very good TA. Was very thorough with grading to make sure we understood our mistakes. Helped with labs without giving away the answers. Very knowledgeable about ML and automatic provers. Live coding sessions were helpful."

"He is one of the best TAs I had at CMU. He makes sure that you understand what is happening in the Labs, and during the work sessions he is very approachable and helpful. His responses in Piazza are very helpful and fast. His way of grading is a bit to stringent in my opinion."

"Very willing to help. Answered questions in much more depth than expected and it was very helpful for understanding the material."
