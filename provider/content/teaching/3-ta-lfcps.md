title: Teaching Assistant for "Logical Foundations of Cyberphysical Systems"
when: Fall 2020
---

I was a Teaching Assistant for the the _Logical Foundations of Cyberphysical Systems_ class taught by Andr√© Platzer at CMU. I created class material optimized for remote learning (due to the COVID pandemic) and taught weekly hybrid recitations. I was nominated to CMU's Alan Perlis Teaching Award (see my [statement](pdf/teaching-statement.pdf)).

"Jonathan is a phenomenal TA of this course. You could tell he cared a lot about the class and the students. He was very helpful in office hours, going through examples and posing practice problems to help me understand the concepts better. I liked how he offered hints but didn't fully give away the answer, which led to more personal learning. For recitation, he did a great job of engaging both the students in person as well as those on line."

"Recitations were always very useful to attend and clarified a lot of things. He obviously cares about the students, so far the most out of any graduate TA I've had."

"The best TA I have ever interacted with. He was able to handle the entire class very efficiently despite being the only TA, and his dedication to our learning was evident. His recitations were super helpful in understanding course material, and they were the most important aspect (along with the active learning quizzes) for solidifying my knowledge in this field. He explained concepts in a way that everyone understood. Additionally, his Office Hours were very effective, and he also gave extra time to his students even if the allotted time for OH was over (sometimes staying up to an hour later). He also dedicated extra time by scheduling an hour long one on one to clarify any conceptual misunderstandings I had. Also, his grading was very prompt, sometimes coming back in less than a day after submission, and reasonable. On top of that, he gave very helpful feedback along with the grades so that we could improve in the future. Overall, this class and TA helped foster a great learning environment."

"Jonathan was SUPER helpful for us this semester. If you're reading this Jonathan, you're like 99% the reason I didn't drop the course. The concepts often felt overwhelming and advanced, but Jonathan was always super patient, encouraging, and engaging, making even the most difficult and abstract concepts seem simple and understandable."
