title: Summer Internship at NASA Langley Research Center 
from: June
to: August 2014
---

I spent three months at the NASA Langley Research Center,
under the supervision of [Alwyn Goodloe](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/aeg/).
I developped the ["Copilot Theorem"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem) 
library, which enables fully-automated verification of safety properties of real-time 
embedded programs written in the [Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
