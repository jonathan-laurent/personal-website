In the "[PPS](https://www.irif.fr/en/poles/pps/index)" team
of the "[Research Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science](https://www.irif.fr//en/index)",
I developped a tactic for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant that
automatically suggests lemmas for proving the current goal.
It relies on a statistical model of lemma relevance, which I fitted on a large corpora
of formalized mathematics (the [CoRN](https://github.com/c-corn/corn) library).
