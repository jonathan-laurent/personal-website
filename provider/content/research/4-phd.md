I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/)).
I have been developing techniques to uncover the causal structure of simulation trajectories generated from rule-based models of complex biochemical systems, in collaboration with the team of [Walter Fontana](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School.
From 2016 to 2018, I was advised by [Jean Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/). I have
been advised by Professor [Andr√© Platzer](http://symbolaris.com/) since.
