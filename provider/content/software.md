I am the lead developer of [AlphaZero.jl](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl).

+ The philosophy of this project is to provide an implementation of AlphaZero that is simple enough to be widely accessible for students and researchers, while also being sufficiently powerful and fast to enable meaningful experiments on limited computing resources.
+ AlphaZero.jl is consistently one to two orders of magnitude faster than existing Python
implementations, while being equally simple and flexible.

I am also actively developing and maintaining the following programs:

+ The [Kappa Trace Query Language](/software/katql-documentation.html): a domain-specific language
for analyzing Kappa simulation traces.
+ The [Kappa Counterfactual Resimulator](/software/kappa-cosimulation.html): a library to sample
counterfactual traces in Kappa.
+ [KaFlow](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaFlow): a program to generate causal summaries of
Kappa traces.
+ [Asciimath compiler](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/personal-website): a compiler from a variant of [asciimath](http://asciimath.org/) to LaTex, written in Haskell.

Finally, I developed the ["Copilot Theorem"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem)
package, which enables fully-automated verification
of safety properties of real-time embedded programs written in the
[Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
