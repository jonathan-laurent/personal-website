I am actively developing and maintaining the following programs:

+ The [Kappa Trace Query Language](/software/katql-documentation.html): a domain-specific language
for analyzing Kappa simulation traces.
+ The [Kappa Counterfactual Resimulator](/software/kappa-cosimulation.html): a library to sample
counterfactual traces in Kappa.
+ [KaFlow](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaFlow): a program to generate causal summaries of
Kappa traces.
+ [Asciimath compiler](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/personal-website): a compiler from a variant of [asciimath](http://asciimath.org/) to LaTex, written in Haskell.

I also developed the ["Copilot Theorem"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem) 
package, which enables fully-automated verification
of safety properties of real-time embedded programs written in the 
[Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
