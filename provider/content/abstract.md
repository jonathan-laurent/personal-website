I am a second-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and a
former student of the [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/en) (Paris).
My research interests lie in the intersection of program analysis, causal inference
and probabilistic modeling. Recently, I have been developing techniques to uncover
the causal structure of simulation trajectories generated from
[rule-based models](https://kappalanguage.org/)
of complex biochemical systems, in collaboration with
[Harvard Medical School](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/).
I am also passionate about [teaching](/cv.html#teaching)
and [programming](/index.html#software) in OCaml.
