Rule-based modeling languages such as Kappa can be used to write mechanistic models of complex biochemical systems. Some techniques have been proposed to analyze the causal structure of such models, ideally providing a way to uncover signalling pathways from networks of low level protein-protein interactions. These methods take advantage of rule structure to (i) slice simulation traces into minimal subsets of events that are sufficient to replicate a phenomenon of interest and (ii) highlight direct causal influences between non-concurrent events.

We propose a different but complementary approach to causal analysis that is based on counterfactual reasoning. We argue that our approach can provide better causal narratives by (i) being more sensitive to kinetics and (ii) providing a proper account of inhibition between molecular events.
