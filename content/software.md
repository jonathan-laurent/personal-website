I am the lead developer of [**AlphaZero.jl**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl):

+ The philosophy of this project is to provide an implementation of
  [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815) that is simple enough to
  be widely accessible for students and researchers, while also being
  sufficiently powerful and fast to enable meaningful experiments on
  limited computing resources.
+ AlphaZero.jl gathered 1200 stars on Github and received two rounds of
  funding from the [_Google Summer of
  Code_](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program.

I am also actively developing and maintaining the following programs for the [Kappa simulation platform](https://kappalanguage.org/):

+ [**KaTie**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaTie):
  a domain-specific language for analyzing Kappa simulation traces.
+ [**Kappa Counterfactual
  Resimulator**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/kappa-counterfactuals):
  a library to sample counterfactual traces in Kappa.
+ [**KaFlow**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaFlow): a program to
  generate causal summaries of Kappa traces.

<br/>

Finally, I developed the [**Copilot
Theorem**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem) package,
which enables fully-automated verification of safety properties of
real-time embedded programs written in the
[Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
