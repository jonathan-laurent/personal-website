- title: PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University
  when: 2017 -- Present
  description: >
    I am currently a PhD researcher in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon
    University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/). Until the end of 2018, I worked with Professor [Jean Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/) on causal analysis of complex biochemical systems, in collaboration with the team of [Walter Fontana](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School. I then joined Professor [AndrÃ© Platzer](http://symbolaris.com/)'s lab, where I have been working at the intersection of language design, maching learning and theorem proving.

- title: Research Internship at IRIF

    In the "[PPS](https://www.irif.fr/en/poles/pps/index)" team of the "[Research
    Institute on the Foundations of Computer Science](https://www.irif.fr//en/index)", I
    developped a tactic for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant that
    automatically suggests lemmas for proving the current goal. It relies on a statistical
    model of lemma relevance, which I fitted on a large corpora of formalized mathematics
    (the [CoRN](https://github.com/c-corn/corn) library).

- title: Research Internship at Harvard Medical School
  when: March -- August 2015
  description:
    In the team of Professor [Walter Fontana](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/), I
    developed a formalism to capture the notion of a biological pathway, along with some
    techniques to uncover pathways in networks of protein-protein interactions modelled
    using the [Kappa](https://kappalanguage.org/) language.

- title: Summer Internship at NASA Langley Research Center
  when: June -- August 2014
  description: >
    I spent three months at the NASA Langley Research Center, under the supervision of
    [Alwyn Goodloe](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/aeg/). I developped the ["Copilot
    Theorem"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem) library, which enables
    fully-automated verification of safety properties of real-time embedded programs
    written in the [Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
