- title: Teaching Assistant for "Logical Foundations of Cyberphysical Systems"
  when: Fall 2020
  description: |
    I was a Teaching Assistant for the the _Logical Foundations of Cyberphysical Systems_
    class taught by André Platzer at CMU. I created class material optimized for remote
    learning (due to the COVID pandemic) and taught weekly hybrid recitations. I was
    nominated to CMU's Alan Perlis Teaching Award (see my
    [statement](pdf/teaching-statement.pdf)).

    "Jonathan is a phenomenal TA of this course. You could tell he cared a lot about the
    class and the students. He was very helpful in office hours, going through examples
    and posing practice problems to help me understand the concepts better. I liked how he
    offered hints but didn't fully give away the answer, which led to more personal
    learning. For recitation, he did a great job of engaging both the students in person
    as well as those on line."

    "Recitations were always very useful to attend and clarified a lot of things. He
    obviously cares about the students, so far the most out of any graduate TA I've had."

    "The best TA I have ever interacted with. He was able to handle the entire class very
    efficiently despite being the only TA, and his dedication to our learning was evident.
    His recitations were super helpful in understanding course material, and they were the
    most important aspect (along with the active learning quizzes) for solidifying my
    knowledge in this field. He explained concepts in a way that everyone understood.
    Additionally, his Office Hours were very effective, and he also gave extra time to his
    students even if the allotted time for OH was over (sometimes staying up to an hour
    later). He also dedicated extra time by scheduling an hour long one on one to clarify
    any conceptual misunderstandings I had. Also, his grading was very prompt, sometimes
    coming back in less than a day after submission, and reasonable. On top of that, he
    gave very helpful feedback along with the grades so that we could improve in the
    future. Overall, this class and TA helped foster a great learning environment."

    "Jonathan was SUPER helpful for us this semester. If you're reading this Jonathan,
    you're like 99% the reason I didn't drop the course. The concepts often felt
    overwhelming and advanced, but Jonathan was always super patient, encouraging, and
    engaging, making even the most difficult and abstract concepts seem simple and
    understandable."

- title: Teaching Assistant for a Software Verification Class
  when: Fall 2017
  description: |
    I was a Teaching Assistant for an introductory software verification class
    ([15-414](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/)), taught by Matt Fredrikson and André
    Plazer. In particular, I designed a set of five labs relying on the
    [Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) verification platform, which led students to writing a
    fully verified implementation of a SAT solver with unit propagation. I was also
    responsible for teaching the two lectures introducing the Why3 platform. [Selected

    "Very good TA. Was very thorough with grading to make sure we understood our mistakes.
    Helped with labs without giving away the answers. Very knowledgeable about ML and
    automatic provers. Live coding sessions were helpful."

    "He is one of the best TAs I had at CMU. He makes sure that you understand what is
    happening in the Labs, and during the work sessions he is very approachable and
    helpful. His responses in Piazza are very helpful and fast. His way of grading is a
    bit to stringent in my opinion."

    "Very willing to help. Answered questions in much more depth than expected and it was
    very helpful for understanding the material."

- title: Oral Examiner in Mathematics
  when: 2015 -- 2016
  description: |
    I was an oral examiner in mathematics at Lycée Condorcet and then [Lycée
    Louis-Le-Grand](http://louislegrand.org/). Every week, I met with six freshmen during
    two one-hour sessions and trained them for the oral entrance examinations of the
    French Grandes Écoles. A selection of some of my favorite exercises can be found
    [here](/pdf/colles.pdf) (currated with [Léonard Blier](http://leonardblier.fr/)).
