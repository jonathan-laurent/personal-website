I am a PhD researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology. My current research interests lie at the
intersection of machine learning and automated theorem proving. My goal
is to implement an AlphaZero-like agent capable of self-learning to
prove and discover mathematical theorems without human supervision.

Previously, I developed techniques to uncover the causal structure of
simulation trajectories generated from [rule-based
models](https://kappalanguage.org/) of complex biochemical systems, in
collaboration with [Harvard Medical
School](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/). I am also passionate about
[teaching](/cv.html#teaching) and [programming](/index.html#software) in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) or [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
