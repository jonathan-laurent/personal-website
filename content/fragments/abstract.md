I am a PhD researcher at [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and at the [Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/). My current research interests
lie at the intersection of machine learning and automated theorem
proving. My goal is to implement an AlphaZero-like agent capable of
self-learning to prove and discover mathematical theorems without human
supervision.

Previously, I developed techniques to uncover the causal structure of
simulation trajectories generated from [rule-based
models](https://kappalanguage.org/) of complex biochemical systems, in
collaboration with [Harvard Medical
School](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/). I am also passionate about
[teaching](/cv.html#teaching) and [programming](/index.html#software) in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) or [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
