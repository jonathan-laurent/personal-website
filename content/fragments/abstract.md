I am a PhD researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/). My current research interests lie at the intersection of language design, machine learning and automated theorem proving. My goal is to implement an AlphaZero-like agent capable of self-learning to prove and discover mathematical theorems without human supervision. I am also exploring new [paradigms](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/delphyne) for integrating LLM prompting as a _first-class_ programming primitive.

Previously, I developed techniques to uncover the causal structure of simulation trajectories generated from [rule-based models](https://kappalanguage.org/) of complex biochemical systems, in collaboration with [Harvard Medical School](https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/). I am also passionate about [teaching](/cv.html#teaching) and [programming](/index.html#software) in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) or [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
