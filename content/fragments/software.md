I am the author of [**Delphyne**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/delphyne), a programming framework for building _reliable_ and _modular_ LLM applications. Delphyne provides a powerful way to combine traditional programming with prompting. It lets you sketch problem-solving strategies as arbitrary _nondeterministic programs_, where choice points are resolved at runtime through prompting and search.

 <!-- Delphyne offers a powerful approach for integrating traditional programming and prompting, where high-level problem solving strategies can be expressed as _nondeterministic_ programs. -->

 <!-- where users can describe high-level problem solving strategies as _arbitrary_ programs with unresolved choice points, to be resolved by LLMs at runtime. -->

<!-- + Users can describe high-level problem solving strategies as arbitrary programs with unresolved choice points. 
+ Policies for navigating the resulting search spaces with LLMs can be independently assembled and tuned.
+ Examples of correct choices can be expressed in a dedicated demonstration language that supports interactive, test-driven development. -->

I am the lead developer of [**AlphaZero.jl**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/AlphaZero.jl):

+ The philosophy of this project is to provide an implementation of
  [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815) that is simple enough to
  be widely accessible for students and researchers, while also being
  sufficiently powerful and fast to enable meaningful experiments on
  limited computing resources.
+ AlphaZero.jl gathered 1300 stars on Github and received three rounds of
  funding from the [_Google Summer of
  Code_](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program.

I am also actively developing and maintaining the following programs for the [Kappa simulation platform](https://kappalanguage.org/):

+ [**KaTie**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaTie):
  a domain-specific language for analyzing Kappa simulation traces.
+ [**Kappa Counterfactual
  Resimulator**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/kappa-counterfactuals):
  a library to sample counterfactual traces in Kappa.
+ [**KaFlow**](https://github.com/jonathan-laurent/KaFlow): a program to
  generate causal summaries of Kappa traces.

<br/>

Finally, I developed the [**Copilot
Theorem**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem) package,
which enables fully-automated verification of safety properties of
real-time embedded programs written in the
[Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/) language.
