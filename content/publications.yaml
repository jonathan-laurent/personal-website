    We propose a new approach to automated theorem proving where an AlphaZero- style agent
    is self-training to refine a generic high-level expert strategy expressed as a
    nondeterministic program. An analogous teacher agent is self-training to generate
    tasks of suitable relevance and difficulty for the learner. This allows leveraging
    minimal amounts of domain knowledge to tackle problems for which training data is
    unavailable or hard to synthesize. As a specific illustration, we consider loop
    invariant synthesis for imperative programs and use neural networks to refine both the
    teacher and solver strategies.

    In this paper, we introduce a unified approach for querying simulation traces of
    rule-based models about the statistical behavior of individual agents. In our
    approach, a query consists in a trace pattern along with an expression that depends on
    the variables captured by this pattern. On a given trace, it evaluates to the multiset
    of all values of the expression for every possible matching of the pattern. We
    illustrate our proposed query language on a simple example, and then discuss its
    semantics and implementation for the Kappa language. Finally, we provide a detailed
    use case where we analyze the dynamics of beta-catenin degradation in Wnt signaling
    from an agent-centric perspective.

    Models based on rules that express local and heterogeneous mechanisms of stochastic
    interactions between structured agents are an important tool for investigating the
    dynamical behavior of complex systems, especially in molecular biology. Given a
    simulated trace of events, the challenge is to construct a causal diagram that
    explains how a phenomenon of interest occurred. Counterfactual analysis can provide
    distinctive insights, but its standard definition is not applicable in rule-based
    models because they are not readily expressible in terms of structural equations. We
    provide a semantics of counterfactual statements that addresses this challenge by
    sampling counterfactual trajectories that are probabilistically as close to the
    factual trace as a given intervention permits them to be. We then show how
    counterfactual dependencies give rise to explanations in terms of relations of
    enablement and prevention between events.

    Rule-based modeling languages such as Kappa can be used to write mechanistic models of
    complex biochemical systems. Some techniques have been proposed to analyze the causal
    structure of such models, ideally providing a way to uncover signalling pathways from
    networks of low level protein-protein interactions. These methods take advantage of
    rule structure to (i) slice simulation traces into minimal subsets of events that are
    sufficient to replicate a phenomenon of interest and (ii) highlight direct causal
    influences between non-concurrent events.

    We propose a different but complementary approach to causal analysis that is based on
    counterfactual reasoning. We argue that our approach can provide better causal
    narratives by (i) being more sensitive to kinetics and (ii) providing a proper account
    of inhibition between molecular events.

    Rule-based modeling languages such as Kappa can be used to write mechanistic models of
    complex reaction systems. Such models consist in collections of stochastic
    graph-rewrite rules that are equipped with different firing rates.

    Ultra-critical systems are growing more complex, and future systems are likely to be
    autonomous and cannot be assured by traditional means. Runtime Verification (RV) can
    act as the last line of defense to protect the public safety, but only if the RV
    system itself is trusted. In this paper, we describe a model-checking framework for
    runtime monitors. This tool is integrated into the Copilot language and framework
    aimed at RV of ultra-critical hard real-time systems. In addition to describing its
    implementation, we illustrate its application on a number of examples ranging from
    very simple to the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm.
