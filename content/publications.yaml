    Models based on rules that express local and heterogeneous mechanisms of stochastic
    interactions between structured agents are an important tool for investigating the
    dynamical behavior of complex systems, especially in molecular biology. Given a
    simulated trace of events, the challenge is to construct a causal diagram that
    explains how a phenomenon of interest occurred. Counterfactual analysis can provide
    distinctive insights, but its standard definition is not applicable in rule-based
    models because they are not readily expressible in terms of structural equations. We
    provide a semantics of counterfactual statements that addresses this challenge by
    sampling counterfactual trajectories that are probabilistically as close to the
    factual trace as a given intervention permits them to be. We then show how
    counterfactual dependencies give rise to explanations in terms of relations of
    enablement and prevention between events.

    Ultra-critical systems are growing more complex, and future systems are likely to be
    autonomous and cannot be assured by traditional means. Runtime Verification (RV) can
    act as the last line of defense to protect the public safety, but only if the RV
    system itself is trusted. In this paper, we describe a model-checking framework for
    runtime monitors. This tool is integrated into the Copilot language and framework
    aimed at RV of ultra-critical hard real-time systems. In addition to describing its
    implementation, we illustrate its application on a number of examples ranging from
    very simple to the Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm.
